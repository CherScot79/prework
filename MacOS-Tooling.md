# MacOS Tooling

[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Homebrew is a [package manager](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) that's going to make it simple to install and manage applications.

Run the following line in Terminal.app and then never use Terminal again.

`brew cask install iterm2`

Now you can open iTerm2.app.

Next, let's install the best code editor in the galaxy! Visual Studio Code! 👏🏻

`brew install visual-studio-code`

Now I'm sure you want to make your code editor more comfy, so checkout these two podcast episodes [here](https://syntax.fm/show/012/why-is-everyone-switching-to-vs-code) and [here](https://syntax.fm/show/048/vs-code-round-two) for the best tips and extensions out there. The podcast is great, but you can just read the show notes.
