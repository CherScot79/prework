[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Homebrew is a [package manager](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) that's going to make it simple to install and manage applications.

Run the following line in Terminal.app and then never use Terminal again.

`brew cask install iterm2`

Now you can open iTerm2.app.

Next, let's install the best code editor in the galaxy! Visual Studio Code! 👏🏻

`brew install visual-studio-code`
