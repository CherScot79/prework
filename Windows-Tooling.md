# Windows Tooling

First, lets install `Chocolatey`, a [package manager](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) for Windows. Go ahead and follow the instructions [here](https://chocolatey.org/install).

Next, we need a terminal that's a little bit better than what's included in Windows by default.

Run this in `PowerShell.exe`:

`choco install cmder`

To make `cmder` more powerful [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) the Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka WSL. Choose Ubuntu as your distribution.

Now lets install the best code editor ever made - Visual Studio Code.

`choco install visualstudiocode`
