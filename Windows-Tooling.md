# Windows Tooling

First, lets install `Chocolatey`, a [package manager](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) for Windows. Go ahead and follow the instructions [here](https://chocolatey.org/install).

Next, we need a terminal that's a little bit better than what's included in Windows by default.

Run this in `PowerShell.exe`:

`choco install cmder`

To make `cmder` more powerful [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) the Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka WSL. Choose Ubuntu as your distribution.

Now lets install the best code editor ever made - Visual Studio Code.

`choco install visualstudiocode`

Now I'm sure you want to make your code editor more comfy, so checkout these two podcast episodes [here](https://syntax.fm/show/012/why-is-everyone-switching-to-vs-code) and [here](https://syntax.fm/show/048/vs-code-round-two) for the best tips and extensions out there. The podcast is great, but you can just read the show notes.

For Windows, check out this Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/633ok7/what_are_some_useful_keyboard_shortcuts_that/).
