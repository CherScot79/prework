### Git

Git is used to track who changed what on files, as well as many other things. It's going to be one of your top tools, so dig into the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc), as well as the links below.

**First, lets get git installed:**

On Mac:
    `brew install git`

On Windows:
    `choco install git.install`

**Next, read through these tutorials and guides!**

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Push yourself to use shortcuts to improve productivity. [Here](https://medium.com/productivity-freak/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-41c8184f65a6) are some good shortcuts, but you'll also want to install CheatSheet.App so that you can see all the shortcuts every app you use has to offer.

`brew cask install cheatsheet`

Then hold down ‚åò for a bit, boom! shortcuts.

For Windows, check out this Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/633ok7/what_are_some_useful_keyboard_shortcuts_that/).
