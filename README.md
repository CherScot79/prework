## Know Your Tool

### Getting Comfy in the Shell

#### If you're on MacOs follow this:

[Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Homebrew is a [package manager](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) that's going to make it simple to install and manage applications.


Run the following line in Terminal.app and then never use Terminal again.

`brew cask install iterm2`

Now you can open iTerm2.app.

#### If you're on Windows look here:

First, lets install `Chocolatey`, a [package manager]() for Windows. Go ahead and follow the instructions [here](https://chocolatey.org/install).

Next, we need a terminal that's a little bit better than what's included in Windows by default.

Run this in `PowerShell.exe`:

`choco install cmder`

To make `cmder` more powerful [install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) the Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka WSL. Choose Ubuntu as your distribution.

#### Git

Git is used to track who changed what on files, as well as many other things. It's going to be one of your top tools, so dig into the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc), as well as the links below.

**First, lets get git installed:**

On Mac:
    `brew install git`

On Windows:
    `choco install git.install`

**Next, read through these tutorials and guides!**

[Guides](https://guides.github.com/) (don't worry too much about reading all of these. Wet your pallette and bookmark for later)

[Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

#### Keyboard Shortcuts

Push yourself to use shortcuts to improve productivity. [Here](https://medium.com/productivity-freak/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-41c8184f65a6) are some good shortcuts, but you'll also want to install CheatSheet.App so that you can see all the shortcuts every app you use has to offer.

`brew cask install cheatsheet`

Then hold down ‚åò for a bit, boom! shortcuts.

For Windows, check out this Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/633ok7/what_are_some_useful_keyboard_shortcuts_that/).
