## Know Your Tool

### MacOs

This is the most popular OS for web developers, if you have it that's great. There's a lot of good tooling out there.

#### Command Line

The command line is your new home. Learn to love it.

1. [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

    Homebrew is a [package manager](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) that's going to make it simple to install and manage applications.

2. Install iTerm

    Run the following line in Terminal.app and then never use Terminal again.

    `brew cask install iterm2`

    Now you can open iTerm2.app.
